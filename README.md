# linkify-server

CURRENT STATE:
A proof of concept of my Linkify idea
It's purpose:
When a song comes on in a shuffle playlist, the user can use this to link together the current song with whatever song(s) they want to play next
EXAMPLE:
I am listening to From Mars by Gojira in my car. I want To Sirus to come next, even though I am shuffling through my huge playlist. I can't go on my phone because I'm driving. I can use Linkify to "link" these songs together, so when From Mars comes on, this will automatically queue up To Sirus. Thanks Linkify!
