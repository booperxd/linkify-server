# linkify-server

## CURRENT STATE:
A proof of concept of my Linkify idea
# Its purpose:
When a song comes on in a shuffle playlist, the user can use this to link together the current song with whatever song(s) they want to play next
## EXAMPLE:
I am listening to From Mars by Gojira in my car. I want To Sirus to come next, even though I am shuffling through my huge playlist. I can't go on my phone because I'm driving. I can use Linkify to "link" these songs together, so when From Mars comes on, this will automatically queue up To Sirus. Thanks Linkify!

# Can I use this?
Not yet. But soon! Maybe? I don't know! We'll get there!

## What needs to be done?
A good bit.
```
1. A user interface, probably on a flutter project so I can make it cross platform.
2. Turn this into a web server. Need to learn how to use OAuth and Spotify API calls across a boundary to do these steps, and this might take a while.
3. Host a web server for this and make it usable.
4. Minor text edits.
